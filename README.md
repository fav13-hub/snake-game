## Summary

This is a small, self-contained Snake game built with Pygame. The repository contains the original script (`snake.py`), a cleaned and runnable version (`snake_fixed.py`), a backup of the original (`snake_backup.py`), and CI to validate the code.

Tech: Python, Pygame, GitHub Actions

## Features

- Player-controlled snake with arrow keys
- Food spawning and scoring
- Collision detection (self and wall)
- Cleaned/refactored code for readability

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- pygame (see `requirements.txt`)

Install requirements:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Run the (refactored) game locally:

```powershell
& 'C:/Users/Obioma Favour/anaconda3/Scripts/conda.exe' run -n datascience --no-capture-output python 'c:\Users\Obioma Favour\Snake game\snake.py'
```

Alternatively run `snake_fixed.py` which is already cleaned and runnable.


## What I implemented

- Refactored and fixed legacy code to be runnable and more readable
- Added project scaffolding: README, LICENSE, requirements, CI workflow
- Implemented basic game loop, scoring display, and collision handling

## Resume bullet examples

- Built a Snake game in Python with Pygame; implemented input handling, food spawning, scoring, and collision detection. Refactored legacy code and added CI and documentation.
- Created project scaffolding (README, LICENSE, requirements) and a GitHub Actions workflow to validate the project.
