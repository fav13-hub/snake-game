# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to help you get started:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/improve-readme`).
- Keep changes small and focused; add tests where appropriate.
- Run the game locally and confirm it runs before submitting a PR.
- Use descriptive commit messages.

If you find a bug, please open an issue with steps to reproduce.
